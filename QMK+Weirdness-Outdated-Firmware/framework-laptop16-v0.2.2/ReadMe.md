## WARNING: These firmware files are massively unsupported / outdated use at your own risk ##

These are alpha state firmware for the Framework 16 Laptop ARGB ANSI Keyboard and Macropad.

It is highly recommended that you have an original firmware for your keyboard + understand how to recover your keyboard from a possible brick (not working) state.

If you accept this, feel free to try these firmware files. (Of course as always we recommend VIA builds first!)

# _Make sure to click the download button for your specific firmware, do not save as or view raw!_ #

**One thing of note if you are attempting to use VIA to configure your keyboard you _must_ quit SignalRGB before running either software**

To use these files you may find QMK Toolbox helpful:
