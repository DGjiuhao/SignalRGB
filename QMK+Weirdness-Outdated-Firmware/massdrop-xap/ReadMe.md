## WARNING: These firmware files are massively unsupported / outdated use at your own risk ##

Source back port from <https://github.com/Massdrop/qmk_firmware/tree/feature/riot_xap> + SignalRGB Protocol.

The directories here are the layouts provided by Massdrop. (Use VIA if you can of course)

---

It is highly recommended that you have an original firmware for your keyboard + understand how to recover your keyboard from a possible brick (not working) state.

If you accept this, feel free to try these firmware files. (Of course as always we recommend VIA builds first!)

Feel free to review + use the patch in [this directory](https://github.com/SRGBmods/QMK-Binaries/tree/main/GPL/qmk_firmware) against [Massdrop]([https://github.com/ab00a/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/Massdrop/qmk_firmware/tree/feature/riot_xap))

---

**One thing of note if you are attempting to use VIA to configure your keyboard you _must_ quit SignalRGB before running either software**

To use these files you may find md_loader useful:
https://github.com/Massdrop/mdloader/releases

You will also need to follow the directions from your Keyboard manufacturer to put it bootloader mode in order to use QMK Toolbox.
(Check their website for directions, you should honestly check there anyways for firmware in case you to need to factory restore as well.)
