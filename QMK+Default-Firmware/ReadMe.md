## Deprecated Builds ##

To use these files you may find QMK Toolbox helpful:
https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases/

You will also need to follow the directions from your Keyboard manufacturer to put it bootloader mode in order to use QMK Toolbox.
(Check their website for directions, you should honestly check there anyways for firmware in case you to need to factory restore as well.)

## Please note these are the last build of __default__ mainline I will do as the VIA builds can happily replace all builds before them. They work the same but you can remap keys with software instead of having to compile a custom keymap (negating these binary builds). Simply put I will not provide any new builds even upon request, unless they include VIA. ##
